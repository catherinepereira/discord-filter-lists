# Discord Filter Lists
Lists of swears, bypasses, inappropriate words, light swears, and threats that can be implemented into auto-moderation bots on Discord.
Provided JSON format is specifically for Gaius Cicerius Bot's wordlist functionality.

TODO: Add generic lists of bad words for auto-moderation bots with less versatility (no RegEx, just wild-carding) such as Dyno or CarlBot.
